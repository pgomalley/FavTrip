**FavTrip Brand Analysis**
This project involves analyzing transaction data from FavTrip gas stations, focusing on identifying various product brands based on keywords within transaction descriptions. 
The analysis enhances understanding of brand preferences across different product categories, notably tobacco and beverages.

**Getting Started**
These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following software and packages installed:
R version 3.3.2 or higher
RStudio or a similar R-compatible IDE
Required R packages:

dplyr
stringr
arules
You can install these packages using install.packages("package_name"). Include a library call for each package at the beginning of your scripts.

**Installation**
Download the project files to your local machine.
Set your working directory in R to the folder containing the project files.

**Scripts and Usage**
BeverageAndTobaccoBrandAdded.R - This script processes the FavTrip2023.csv file to identify and append a new Brand column based on predefined keywords. Outputs BeverageCategoryData.csv.
AddingColumns.R - Adds date and time columns to the data, converting date strings to POSIXct datetime objects. 
It uses Finalized_Data.csv to output data_for_modeling.csv with additional date-related information.
BindGroceryBrands.R - Combines brand data from BeverageCategoryData.csv and groceries_brands.csv, excluding the "GROCERY" department from the former. 
The script outputs the combined data to Finalized_Data.csv.
MarketBasketAnalysis.R - Performs market basket analysis to find associations between brands based on transaction data. 
The script processes data_for_modeling.csv and outputs association rules for various brands.
Outputs
Each script outputs a CSV file that serves as an input for the next step in the analysis pipeline:

BeverageCategoryData.csv
Finalized_Data.csv
data_for_modeling.csv
Additionally, association rules are displayed within the console and can be redirected to a file if required.

**Project Structure**
The project is structured sequentially where each script is dependent on the outputs of the previous scripts:

Identification of brands.
Addition of date and time data.
Binding of grocery data.
Market basket analysis for discovering brand associations.
Versioning
Version 1.0 of the FavTrip Brand Analysis.
